# Diary of a... WHO?

![cabin fever cover](./img/cabinfever.png)

## Dear Reader,
Most people look forward to Spring Break. But, for Amherst students and many college students across the country, the start of Spring Break marked a fundamental change in our lives. 
\newline
For those who circumstances allowed it, we would be sent home, not for vacation purposes, but to ride out the rest of our semesters in quarantine. 

This diary is dedicated to answering the basic question: "how do I spend my time?"

For 14 days straight, I used Google Calendar to schedule my time. I primarily used two different calendars, my intended schedule, and my real schedule. At the end of each day, I made a schedule of what I intended to do the next day, and when I intended to do them. 
Then, I would record what I actually did during the days in a separate, real scheudule. 

At the end of this two week period, I collected my data for wrangling and analysis.

###Motivation + primary questions of interest
Here are the primary questions of interest that I wanted to answer at the end of the two weeks.

- What activity do I spend most of my time on, on a weekly basis? 

- When (what weekday) do I accomplish the most homework?

- How much time do I spend multitasking while doing my homework on a weekly basis?

- How much time per week am I spending on my hobbies now, vs. when I was on campus?

These questions will also be explored considering what I intended to do versus what I actually accomplished. 


# Results

Here's what I found! 

#insert image here

First, I took a look at an overview of the activities that I plotteed in my intended and real calendars, and how much time I alloted for each task. 

I chose to measure my time in minutes. Note that instead of plotting total amount of time spent over the two weeks, I decided to plot average time spent on these activities per weekday, so that I could look at what I would expect my time distribution to be for a single week  (for example, if I spent 120 minutes in total watching anime on Mondays, I would only plot 120/2 = 60 minutes for Monday). We can first observe what I intended to accomplish.


I can see from the bar chart below that the majority of my week was planned to be spent on doing homework. My schedule shows that I intended to clock in 2,825 minutes or 47.08 hours a week just working on homework! (Wow!) Given, this was a very busy time in the semester, so that may explain it. Notably, I also intended to do most of my homework on Wednesdays, and do the least amount on Fridays. 

\newline
Coming in at second place is class time. I intended to spend 557.5 minutes per week in class, which is about 9.3 hours. That's pretty much in line with how often/how long my classes are collectively scheduled to be.  
\newline
Next, my hobbies were sprinkled into my schedule, which I'll take a more in-depth look at later in the report. Just from a glance, it seems that I intended to spend about the same amount of time watching anime, cooking, gaming, and singing per week. I have some scheduled dancing time sprinkled in there as well. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# the "echo=FALSE" code chunk option suppresses the code from this chunk from appearing in the knit file, but the code will still evaluate and the output will show up in the knit file

bleh <- real_grouped %>%
  filter(activity == "Cooking")
sum(bleh$min_spent_per_day)
bleh

bleh2 <- intend_grouped %>%
  filter(activity == "Cooking")
  sum(bleh2$min_spent_per_day)
  
  
ggplot(data = intend_grouped, aes(x = activity, y = min_spent_per_day, fill = weekday)) + geom_col() + labs(y = "minutes per day", title = "Intended Time Spent on Activities per day") + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -85)) + theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title=element_text(size=9))
```

Now on to what I actually accomplished. As far as distributions go, I accomplished more or less what I intended to do, with some variation. 

Homework still clocks in as the activity that takes up most of my time on a weekly basis. However, it seems that I spent less time than I intended to doing homework. I really spent an average of 2,525 minutes, 42.08 hours, per week doing homework. Even if it's just a 5 hour difference, I learned that my school work took me less time than I thought it would take me. 42.08 hours a week is already enough time dedicated to sitting in my chair and typing/writing away at my assignments, so I'm glad that I may have gotten the opportunity to spend more time on my hobbies. What's interesting here though, is even though I spent the most time doing homework on Wednesdays as I intended, I actually spent the same amount of time doing homework on Saturdays as well (480 minutes/ 8 hours each). Furthermore, as I expected to do the least amount of homework on Fridays, I actually did almost the same amount of homework on Fridays as I did on Wednesdays and Saturdays. I actually did the least amount of homework on Thursdays. 
\newline
The animated bar chart and table below look at homework more closely, and highlight the differences between my two schedules.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

real_grouped_homework <- real_grouped %>%
  filter(activity == "Homework") 

intend_grouped_homework <- intend_grouped %>%
  filter(activity == "Homework") 

grouped_homework_col <- cbind(real_grouped_homework, intend_grouped_homework)

real_grouped_homework <- real_grouped_homework %>%
  mutate(schedule = "Real")
intend_grouped_homework <- intend_grouped_homework %>%
  mutate(schedule = "Intended")


grouped_homework_df <- rbind(real_grouped_homework, intend_grouped_homework)

myPlot <- ggplot(data = grouped_homework_df, aes(x = schedule, y = min_spent_per_day, fill = weekday)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + labs(y = "Avg. Minutes per. day", title = "Time Spent on Homework per Day") + theme_wsj() + theme(plot.title = element_text(size=13), legend.title = element_text(size=10)) + theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12)) +
  # gganimate specific bits:
  transition_states(
    weekday,
    transition_length = 2,
    state_length = 1
  ) +
  ease_aes('sine-in-out')

# Save at gif:
animate(myPlot, duration = 8, fps = 20, width = 200, height = 200, renderer = gifski_renderer())
anim_save("output.gif")

grouped_homework_col <- grouped_homework_col%>%
  select(weekday, min_spent_per_day, min_spent_per_day1)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}

kable(grouped_homework_col, 
      col.names = c("Weekday", "Real Avg Minutes/day", "Intended Avg Minutes/day"), booktabs = TRUE, escape = FALSE, align = "c", "latex", caption = "Time Doing Homework by Schedule per. Day") %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```


Coming in second place, as expected, is class time. Evidently, I spent on average, 647.5 minutes or 10.8 hours in class per week. That is about 1.5 hours more than what I intended. Note that I also counted office hours as 'class time', so that would probably explain this difference.
\newline

My hobbies were actually sprinkled into my schedule, but lo and behold, I actually spent more time gaming and watching anime than I intended, but less time singing, cooking, and dancing than I intended. In fact, I didn't get to dance at all!

```{r, echo = FALSE}


ggplot(data = real_grouped, aes(x = activity, y = min_spent_per_day, fill = weekday)) + geom_col()+ labs(y = "minutes per day", title = "Real Time Spent on Activities per day") + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -85)) + theme_fivethirtyeight()






```

##Homework and Multi-tasking 

Now, let's focus in on homework and multitasking. I decided to do this, because I had a unique multitaking element to doing homework, that I didn't list for any other activity in my schedules. When I was just doing homework, I marked that activity as 'Homework'. But when I did homework at the same time as another activity, I would mark it as 'Homework + [insert activity here]'. In my case, the other activity was always either watching anime or gaming. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}

homework_real <- homework_real %>%
  select(length_min, multitask)%>%
  group_by(multitask) %>%
  summarise(total_min = sum(length_min))

homework_intended <- homework_intended %>%
  select(length_min, multitask) %>%
  group_by(multitask) %>%
  summarise(total_min = sum(length_min))

homework_real2 <- homework_real %>%
  mutate(schedule = "Real",
         prop = total_min/sum(total_min))

homework_intended2 <- homework_intended %>%
  mutate(schedule = "Intended",
          prop = total_min/sum(total_min))

homework_df <- rbind(homework_real2, homework_intended2)

  mutate(multitask_label = ifelse(multitask == "TRUE", "Multitasking",
                                  "No Multitasking"))


  ggplot(data = homework_df, aes(x = multitask_label, y = prop, fill = multitask_label)) + geom_col() + facet_grid(~schedule) + labs(x = "Multitasking?", y = "Proportion", title = "Proportion of Homework Done Multitasking by Schedule Type") + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -15)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + theme_wsj() + theme(plot.title = element_text(size=11), legend.title = element_text(size=10)) + theme(axis.title=element_text(size=9))
